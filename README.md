# Waffle TX2

We installed a TX2 and a ZED camera onto a Turtlebot 3 Waffle Pi. This repository contains ROS driver and configuration software for this robot, to be used in addition to Robotis's software. We will probably also include engineering documentation of the robot (esp. the power distribution modifications we had to make) at some point.
